Guessing-Ground Game Project

1. Project Overview:
 - A user-friendly Python project designed for beginners.
 - Engages players in a guessing game where they attempt to guess a randomly generated number within the range of 1-100.
 - Provides an interactive command line interface for a two-player competition.

2. Project Features:
 - Core Programming Concepts:
 - Implements fundamental programming concepts such as variables, loops, and conditional logic.
 - Scoring System:
 - Features an easy-to-understand scoring system that awards or deducts points based on the accuracy of players' guesses.
 - Score Display:
 - Prints player scores after each round, keeping participants informed and engaged.
 -Random Number Generation:
 - Leverages the built-in Python module 'random' for generating random numbers, adding an element of unpredictability.
 - Built-in Modules:
 - Makes use of Python's built-in modules like random and time to enhance functionality.

3. Key Functions:
 - Generates a random number based on three difficulty levels, introducing an element of challenge and variety.
 - Checks each guess against the target number, updating player points accordingly.

4. Code Clarity:
 - Includes comments throughout the script to explain the logic and flow, ensuring readability for both developers and learners.

5. How to Play:
 - Players take turns guessing a random number.
 - Scoring is based on the proximity of the guess to the actual number.
 - The player with the highest score at the end of the rounds is declared the winner.

6. Future Plans:
 - As a developer, future plans involve enhancing the game by incorporating user feedback, adding new features, and improving the user interface. Stay tuned for updates!
